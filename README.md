# LangGraph-Experiments
Experiments with LangGraph for building and testing dynamic LLM workflows and agent-based applications.

- **`1_first_code.ipynb`**  
  A minimal example to get started with LangGraph. It shows how to define a basic LangGraph workflow with simple nodes and transitions.

- **`2_PromptChaining.ipynb`**  
  Demonstrates a multi-step prompt chaining process using LangGraph. It shows how outputs from one node can be passed to the next, simulating step-by-step reasoning or agent-like behavior.

- **`3_LLM_based_SimpleWorkflows.ipynb`**
  A more applied example showing how to create an LLM-driven workflow using LangGraph. This can simulate real-world pipelines.


  ## Key Concepts

- **LangGraph**: A powerful way to build stateful graph-based reasoning using LLMs.
- **Prompt Chaining**: Connecting multiple prompts so each step builds on the previous one.
- **Graph Nodes**: Each node represents a function, LLM call, or action.
- **Shared State**: State is passed and updated across nodes, allowing dynamic and reusable flows.
