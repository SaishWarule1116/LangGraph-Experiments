# LangGraph-Experiments
Experiments with LangGraph for building and testing dynamic LLM workflows and agent-based applications.

- **`1_first_code.ipynb`**  
  A minimal example to get started with LangGraph. It shows how to define a basic LangGraph workflow with simple nodes and transitions.

- **`2_PromptChaining.ipynb`**  
  Demonstrates a multi-step prompt chaining process using LangGraph. It shows how outputs from one node can be passed to the next, simulating step-by-step reasoning or agent-like behavior.
